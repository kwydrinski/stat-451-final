# 1) Color Pallets

When using color in visualizations there are different kinds of pallets that can
be used.

## a. Pallet 1

Describe the pallet and explain when you would use such a pallet.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('1a.png')
```

The palette above is an example of sequential color schemes using multi-hued
colors. 

Each scheme is sequential because it allows the highlighting of order in data
through the use of shading. Within a given hue such as blue, there are multiple
shades from light to dark. The lightness or darkness of the hue can be used to
represent different levels of values. Typically, light hues represent low
values and dark hues represent high values.

Each scheme is multi-hued meaning the colors used are not just shades of a
single hue but instead, use multiple hues. When using multiple hues, the
palettes still provide a pleasing aethetic transition from lighter shades to
darker shades that preserves the implied sequential meaning of the collective
colors.

Sequential colors schemes are suited to highlighted data that can be categorized
into ordered categories. Examples could be age ranges, levels of experience,
density ranges, etc.

## b. Pallet 2

Describe the pallet and explain when you would use such a pallet.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('1b.png')
```

***

The palette above is an example of diverging color schemes. Each scheme is
diverging because it allows the highlighting of both central and extreme values
in underlying data. Lighter shades and hues are used as the central colors in
each of these palettes. In the palettes above, each has five (5) colors with
the third (3) color being the central, lightest color. Moving away from this
color in either direction towards the first and last colors in the palette, the
shades and hues get darker. The colors diverge away from a light, neutral color
towards darker, more distinct colors. The colors at the ends of the palettes
typically contrast highly from each other to help amplify the meaning of the
divergence in the underlying data away from its central values.

Diverging colors schemes are suited to highlight the central and extreme value
in data distributions. The light coloring of central values tends to indicate
the typical values of data while the bold, contrasting coloring of extreme
values tends to highlight these extreme values. Examples could be grade
distributions, income level distributions, age ranges, etc.

Note that many datasets could be highlighted by either sequential or diverging
schemes. For example, age ranges could be highlighted by either. However, the
intent of the visualization would help dictate which to use. Consider a
question posed such as "Comparing pre-teen, teen, adult, and eldery
populations...?" Now consider a second, similar question posed such as "What are
the average ages...?" The first question is being posed from a categorial
perspective that implies a sequence tied to human lifecycles. There is implied
interest in order so a sequential color scheme would be applicable. For the
second question, there was not much emphasis on any difference between young or
old but instead more interest in the distribution, the *average*. In this case,
a diverging color scheme may be more suited to the vizualization to not only
highlight the average (central valeus) but also highlight the extremes.

## c. Pallet 3

Describe the pallet and explain when you would use such a pallet.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('1c.png')
```

***

The palette above is an example of qualitative color schemes. Each scheme is
designed with a set of color shades and hues that contrast from one another.
Sequential and diverging color schemes do not try to contrast as much but
instead try to show more relationship or transitioning of values between each
color. Qualitative schemes try to show the contrast as much as possible
attempting to highlighted the grouping and differences more than the
similarities or nearness to other groups.

Qualitative color schemes are best used when tyring to depict different
categories of data that are more distinct from each other than they are as
similar or close to one another. Examples include demographic data such as
racial identity, gender identity, political affiliation, religious affiliation,
sports team fan affiliation, etc.

# 2) Earthquakes

Here is the link to the USGS website where the worldwide
[earthquake](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/) data can be
downloaded. Download all earthquake data for the past 30 days in .csv format.
Using R, make a map of the world with points where the earthquakes occurred.
Make a bubble map using the magnitude. Thoroughly discuss your visualizations.
